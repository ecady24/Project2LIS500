        <p>
            I am majoring in computer science, data science, and mathematics,
            with a minor in graphic design. 
        </p>

        <h3>Technology & Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Design has taught me that presentation is never neutral.
            Two charts built from the same dataset can communicate entirely different narratives. 
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
        <p>
            As someone entering the tech field, I wanted to better understand the social impact of systems often described as objective.
            This course pushed me to ask:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Who designs these systems?</li>
            <li>What assumptions are embedded within them?</li>
            <li>Who benefits or is harmed when those assumptions go unexamined?</li>
        </ul>
