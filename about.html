        <h2>Evelyn Cady</h2>

        <p>
            I am a senior here at UW Madison and am studying Graphic Design and Philosophy.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology & Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Around two years ago, I took part in a program through WAISI (Wisconsin AI Safety Initiative) that explored
            implicit bias in AI and how large language models base their results upon data that may be misrepresentational or
            misguided. I am interested to see how this course will continue to relate to what I learned in that program and expand
            the ideas I had before.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
        <p>
            I began my time in college as a Computer Science major, and in my last semester, thought it would be 
            cool to finish off my coursework by "coming full circle" and taking a more technology-based course than 
            what I have now grown used to. Accessibility and representation is something that is very important to me
            in the world of Graphic Design, so this course work is able to fill that interest along with allowing me to 
            brush off some coding practices and learn a thing or two about HTML/CSS.

        <h2>Derek Jones</h2>

        <p>
            I am majoring in psychology with certificates in digital media analytics and digital studies.
        </p>

        <h3>Technology & Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Throughout history, technology has revealed as much about human nature as it has transformed it. Every new tool reflects the intentions, 
            assumptions, and biases of the people who create it. Recognizing that there is always a human behind the invention has made 
            me more critical, and my major and certificate coursework has empowered me to examine how that human element impacts people.
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
        <p>
            I took this class because I wanted to build my tehnical skills by getting exposure to coding, but do so within 
            the context of something that matters while I finish my digital studies certificate. Code and Power will allow 
            me to develop technical knowledge, strengthen my own ethical framework, and improve upon my understanding of 
            ways technology can challenge and reinforce existing
            systems of power.

        <h2>Vivi Tran</h2>

        <p>
            I am majoring in computer science, data science, and mathematics,
            with a minor in graphic design. 
        </p>

        <h3>Technology & Perspective</h3>
        <p>
            Design has taught me that presentation is never neutral.
            Two charts built from the same dataset can communicate entirely different narratives. 
        </p>

        <h3>Why I Took This Class</h3>
        <p>
            As someone entering the tech field, I wanted to better understand the social impact of systems often described as objective.
            This course pushed me to ask:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Who designs these systems?</li>
            <li>What assumptions are embedded within them?</li>
            <li>Who benefits or is harmed when those assumptions go unexamined?</li>
        </ul>
