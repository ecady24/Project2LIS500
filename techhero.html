    <h2>Joy Buolamwini</h2>

    <p>
        Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist, digital activist, and founder
        of the Algorithmic Justice League. Her work exposes bias in machine
        learning systems, especially in facial recognition software that
        performs worse on women and people of color.
    </p>

    <p>
        While studying at the MIT Media Lab, Buolamwini found that many
        commercial AI systems struggled to identify her face until she
        wore a lighter mask. This experience inspired her research into
        algorithmic bias and fairness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the Algorithmic Justice League, she advocates for more
        equitable and accountable AI systems. Her work combines research,
        storytelling, and policy engagement to address the harms caused
        by biased technology.
