    <!-- Biography Section -->
    <p>
        Joy Buolamwini is a computer scientist, digital activist, and founder of the Algorithmic Justice League. 
        She is referred to as the “Poet of Code.” AJL is a non-profit organization working to expose bias in machine learning systems, 
        especially in facial recognition software that performs worse on women and people of color. 
        Her efforts integrate research, activism, and artistic expression to ensure that AI is both fair and accountable.
    </p>

    <p>
        While studying at the MIT Media Lab, Buolamwini found that many commercial AI systems struggled to identify her face 
        until she wore a lighter mask.  This experience led her to coin the term “the coded gaze,” which refers to how the
        biases, agendas, and blind spots of the people who develop technology are encoded into the technology itself. 
        AI systems are trained on “pale male” data sets that do not reflect the diversity of humanity. 
        This experience inspired her research into algorithmic bias and fairness.
    </p>

    <p>
        Dr. Buolamwini has also testified before the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Reform, urging a moratorium 
        on the use of facial recognition in policing due to its disproportionate negative effect on marginalized communities. 
        She also highlights the effects of biased algorithms on economic opportunities, such as 
        hiring, loan approval, workplace monitoring, and access to employment platforms.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through the Algorithmic Justice League, she advocates for more
        equitable and accountable AI systems. Her work combines research,
        storytelling, and policy engagement to address the harms caused
        by biased technology.
